## Environment Variables in React

Environment variables are variables which are present outside the project and embedded into the project during _build time_. The CRA generates static HTML/CSS/JS bundles, hence it cannot read them at runtime.

> Note: Environment variables are explained for React project created using `create-react-app`.

## Benefits of Environment Variables

### Hide Sensitive Information in Code

A project can have sensitive information which cannot be shared by another person and can be potentially misused. A few examples of sensitive information are secret or private keys for an API service like Firebase, MailJet and other services which can be used in the project.

### Configure Multiple Development Environments

We require multiple environments like development, production, test, and UAT. Each environment can have a different configuration for various features like Database, deployment URL, and secret keys for various services.

## Create Custom Environment Variables In `.env`

We can define the environment variables for react project by creating a `.env` file at the root of the project.

All the environment variables should always start with `REACT_APP_`, Otherwise it will be ignored.

> Note: The development server must be restarted after changing the `.env` files. Similarly, the code needs to rebuild to update the build code with new environment configuration changes.

There is an example of a `.env` file.

```plaintext
REACT_APP_PROJECT_TITLE = React Project - Dev
REACT_APP_API_CLIENT_BASE_URL = https://api.dev.project.com
```

## Access Environment Variables

### HTML (`public/index.html`)

Add `%` before and after the environment variable name to access the value.

```xml
<title>%REACT_APP_PROJECT_TITLE%</title>
```

### JavaScript / TypeScript (`.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx`)

```javascript
const baseURL = process.env.REACT_APP_API_CLIENT_BASE_URL;
```

## Variations of `.env`

The selection of environment files changes depending on the script used in React project. The priority of environment files decreases from left to right.

### npm start

`npm start` runs the app in `development` mode.

`.env.development.local`, `.env.local`, `.env.development`, `.env`

### npm run build

`npm run build` builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

`.env.production.local`, `.env.local`, `.env.production`, `.env`

### npm test

`npm test` runs the app in `test` mode.

`.env.test.local`, `.env.test`, `.env`

> Local variations of `.env` which are `.env.local`, `.env.development.local`, `.env.test.local`, `.env.production.local` should not be source controlled.

## Custom Build Scripts for Other Environments

By now, we know that CRA provides to have `development`, `production` and `testing`.

Here are a few scenarios where you would need to create custom scripts.

1. Configure a new environment which is not available in predefined variants.
2. Choose which environment files to use to generate build code.
3. Use a different name for the environment files other than the predefined variants.

> This problem is solved by using an NPM package `env-cm` which allows the creation of scripts using an environment from a `.env` file.

### Install `env-cm` NPM package

```bash
npm i env-cmd
```

### Create Environment Configuration for UAT

Let us assume I have a new environment called `UAT`. First, we have to create `.env.uat` file.

```plaintext
REACT_APP_PROJECT_TITLE = React Project - UAT
REACT_APP_API_CLIENT_BASE_URL = https://api.uat.project.com
```

### Create scripts in `package.json`

The command to run a script with a preferred environment file  
`env-cmd -f <ENVIRONMENT-FILE-NAME> <SCRIPT-TO-RUN>`

The scripts in the below code snippet are used to create an optimized production build using the respective environment files.

```js
"build:production": "env-cmd -f .env.production react-scripts build",
"build:uat": "env-cmd -f .env.uat react-scripts build",
```

### Generate Build Code for `UAT` environment

```bash
npm run build:uat
```

### Run build code

```bash
npm install -g serve
serve -s build
```
