[Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) are used to get the result from an asynchronous code execution in JavaScript. In a web application, Promises are used almost everywhere. Every data that flows in and out of the application to a remote server is an asynchronous call.

## Create a Promise

### Using `Promise()` constructor

The `Promise()` constructor takes an executor function which receives two parameters. They are `resolveFunc` and `rejectFunc`.

```typescript
const timer = async (timeoutInMilliSeconds: number): Promise<string> => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    if (timeoutInMilliSeconds < 0) {
      reject('Timer stopped as timeoutInMilliSeconds is negative');
    } else {
      setTimeout(() => {
        resolve('Timer successfully completed');
      }, timeoutInMilliSeconds);
    }
  });
};
```

## Executing a Promise

### Using `then` and `catch`

```typescript
const timerWithoutAsync = (timeoutInMilliSeconds: number): void => {
  console.log('Timer started');
  timer(timeoutInMilliSeconds)
    .then((result) => {
      console.log(result);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.log(error);
    });
  console.log('Timer Finished');
};
```

If `timeoutInMilliSeconds` is positive, `setTimeout` is executed. Callback provided to `setTimeout` is executed when the `timeoutInMilliSeconds` is elapsed.

The callback executes the `resolve` function which returns a string to `timerWithoutAsync`.  
The return value is passed to the `then` block callback which logs the string to the console.

If `timeoutInMilliSeconds` is negative, `reject` function is executed which returns a string to `timerWithoutAsync`.  
The return value from `reject` is considered similar to an error and hence it is passed to the `catch` block callback which logs the error to the console.

### Using `async` and `await`

```typescript
const timerWithAsync = async (timeoutInMilliSeconds: number): Promise<void> => {
  console.log('Timer started');
  try {
    const result = await timer(timeoutInMilliSeconds);
    console.log(result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
  console.log('Timer Finished');
};
```

If `timeoutInMilliSeconds` is positive, `setTimeout` is executed. Callback provided to `setTimeout` is executed when the `timeoutInMilliSeconds` is elapsed.

The callback executes the `resolve` function which returns a string to `timerWithAsync` and is stored inside the variable `result`. The `result` is logged into the console.

If `timeoutInMilliSeconds` is negative, the `reject` function is executed which returns a string to `timerWithAsync`.  
The return value from `reject` is considered similar to an error and hence it is caught by the `try-catch` block which logs the error to the console.

## Difference between `then-catch` vs `async-await`

The key difference between using `then-catch` and `async-await` is the order in which the consecutive code is executed.

By using `then-catch`, the code execution continues without waiting for the promise to be fulfilled. Let us run `timerWithoutAsync(5000)` and see the console statements.

1. "Timer Started" was logged.
2. "Timer Finished" was immediately logged.
3. After 5 seconds "Timer successfully completed" is logged.

By using `async-await`, the code execution is stopped and waits for the promise to be fulfilled. Let us run `timerWithAsync(5000)` and see the console statements.

1. "Timer Started" was logged.
2. After 5 seconds "Timer successfully completed" is logged.
3. "Timer Finished" was immediately logged.

Both are used often in the code depending on the use cases. If you can want to stop the execution until the promise is complete then use `async-await` syntax otherwise you can use `then-catch` syntax.

## Execute Promises Sequentially

Promises can be executed sequentially when the next promise is dependent on the previous promise result.

```typescript
const executeTimerSequentially = async (): Promise<void> => {
  const result1 = await timer(1000);
  console.log(result1);
  const result2 = await timer(2000);
  console.log(result2);
  const result3 = await timer(3000);
  console.log(result3);
};
```

1. `timer(1000)` is executed.
2. After 1 second, `result1` is logged.
3. `timer(2000)` is executed.
4. After 2 seconds, `result2` is logged.
5. `timer(3000)` is executed.
6. After 3 seconds, `result3` is logged.

The total time to complete `executeTimerSequentially` is 1+2+3 = 6 seconds.

### Promise Chaining

Similar results can be achieved using `then()` block using promise chaining.

```typescript
const executeTimerSequentially = async (): Promise<void> => {
  timer(1000)
    .then((result1) => {
      console.log(result1);
      return timer(2000);
    })
    .then((result2) => {
      console.log(result2);
      return timer(3000);
    })
    .then((result3) => {
      console.log(result3);
    });
};
```

## Execute Promises Parallelly

Promises can be executed parallelly when the next promise is independent of the previous promise result.

```typescript
const executeTimerParallely = async (): Promise<void> => {
  const promise1 = timer(1000);
  const promise2 = timer(2000);
  const promise3 = timer(3000);
  const [result1, result2, result3] = await Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3]);
  console.log(result1);
  console.log(result2);
  console.log(result3);
};
```

`timer(1000)`, `timer(2000)`, `timer(3000)` will start the execution parallelly.

`Promise.all()` takes in an array of promises and returns the result the all the promises only if all the promises are resolved otherwise it will be rejected. Since we are using `await`, It will wait for all the promises to resolve before logging the results.

The total time to complete executeTimerParallely is max(1, 2, 3) = 3 seconds.

### Another example for `Promise.all()`

Assume we have an array of user IDs in `userIds` and we have an API function `getUserDetails` which gets the user details for the given user ID. Using `map` array arrow function, we get an array of promises to fetch the user details for each user ID.  
We are using `await` and `Promise.all()` to make sure all the user details are fetched before logging the list of users.

```typescript
const userIds = ['001', '002', '003'];
const getUsers = async (): Promise<void> => {
  const users = await Promise.all(
    userIds.map((userId) => {
      getUserDetails(userId);
    })
  );
  console.log(users);
};
```
